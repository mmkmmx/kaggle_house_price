## Summary
Using the variables Neighborhood, YearBuilt, FirstFlrSF, SecondFlrSF, GarageArea we generated a model that produced the following outputs when predicting SalesPrice:

* R^2:.77
* Kaggle Score:0.24
* Kaggle Ranking: 3702

## Data Transformation 
We used our domain knowledge of real estate prices to identify the variables that we believe would be good predictors of the SalesPrice target variable.  

We experimented with other combinations including  ###this this and this### but these all resulted in lower in-sample R^2 values.
